# plume — agent notes

The portfolio-wide rules in `~/Documents/portfolio/CLAUDE.md` apply here.

<!-- factotum:blocked-protocol -->
**Blockers → Jira (fleet repo, system standard).** Anything only Evan can resolve — a credential, a deploy, external access, or a decision — becomes a ticket in the Jira `EA` space on *Needs Evan*, component `plume`, **with the specific steps a human takes to unblock it** (the action, where, any URL / path / env-var). From a session on Evan's Mac, file it with `uv run --project ~/Documents/_system sys file-blocker --component plume --title "…" --body-file steps.md` (add `--nice-to-have` for 🟡; default 🔴); fleet daemon runs on the box park their own ticket on *Needs Evan* instead. Two kinds stay in the root `BLOCKED.md`, in the standard format: **`[sec]` blockers** (`- [ ] 🔴 [sec] …`, because the security dashboard counts them only there, D-052) and anything Jira must not hold — roster/user data, secret values, unpublished writing (D-039). `BLOCKED.md` keeps its heading and a pointer to Jira. _system's blocked-router mirrors both into Evan's todo dashboard. Full rule: Evan's global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and _system D-051/D-052.
